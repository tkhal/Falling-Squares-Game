# Falling-Squares-Game
A fun little program I made :)

To run, either install python on your computer or open up python in your favorite IDE. 

Open up command prompt or any other terminal, and paste the following: " git clone https://github.com/tkhal/Falling-Squares-Game.git "

Open up Visual Studio Code, or any other Python IDE and open up the Main.py file

Run the program, and don't get hit by the squares!
